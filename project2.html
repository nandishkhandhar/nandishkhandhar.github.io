    <h1>Project 2 - Fun with Filters and Frequencies</h1>
    
    <h2>1.1 - Finite Difference Operator and Gradient Magnitude</h2>
    <p>The original image was first convolved with the finite difference operators to produce Ix and Iy. The gradient 
        magnitude was then computed by taking the norm (np.sqrt(Ix**2 + Iy**2)) of the [Ix Iy] vector. Shown below are the images
    of all steps, including creating the binary edge image by enforcing a threshold.</p>

    <h2>1.2 - Gaussian Filters</h2>
    <p>In this version, the only difference is that the image was convolved with a gaussian blurring filter beforehand. This means that
    the transitions between edges are smoothed, making the gradient magnitude more apparent. The visual differences seen in the result
    are better highlighted/thicker edges. Images are shown below</p>

    <p>For this part, the program runs a single convolution, and the results are the same, as displayed below</p>

    <h2>2.1 - Image Sharpening</h2>
    <p>The image sharpening process starts with extracting the high frequencies from the image. This is done through applying a gaussian blur 
    filter and then subtracting the blurred image (low frequencies) from the original to get the high frequencies. Then, I have added the high 
    frequencies to the original image, where the high frequencies are weighted by different alphas.</p>

    <h2>2.2 - Hybrid Images and Fourier Analysis</h2>
    <p>As described in the project spec, the hybrid images were created by low-pass filtering one image and high-pass filtering the second image
    and then combining the two. The two examples and one failed example are shown below. The hyperparameter values for the Gaussian filter were
    set through experimentation and qualitative assesment.</p>

    <p>The Fourier output images are calculated as shown in the spec for the Cat and Derek image combination</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I have taken some inspiration from ChatGPT and pretrained LLM's to create the structure for some parts of the website.</p>
