    <h1>Project 2 - Fun with Filters and Frequencies</h1>
    
    <h2>1.1 - Finite Difference Operator and Gradient Magnitude</h2>
    <p>The original image was first convolved with the finite difference operators to produce Ix and Iy. The gradient 
        magnitude was then computed by taking the norm (np.sqrt(Ix**2 + Iy**2)) of the [Ix Iy] vector. Shown below are the images
    of all steps, including creating the binary edge image by enforcing a threshold.</p>

    <h2>1.2 - Gaussian Filters</h2>
    <p>In this version, the only difference is that the image was convolved with a gaussian blurring filter beforehand. This means that
    the transitions between edges are smoothed, making the gradient magnitude more apparent. The visual differences seen in the result
    are better highlighted/thicker edges. Images are shown below</p>

    <p>For this part, the program runs a single convolution, and the results are the same, as displayed below</p>

    <h2>2.1 - Image Sharpening</h2>
    <p>The image sharpening process starts with extracting the high frequencies from the image. This is done through applying a gaussian blur 
    filter and then subtracting the blurred image (low frequencies) from the original to get the high frequencies. Then, I have added the high 
    frequencies to the original image, where the high frequencies are weighted by different alphas.</p>

    <h2>2.2 - Hybrid Images and Fourier Analysis</h2>
    <p>As described in the project spec, the hybrid images were created by low-pass filtering one image and high-pass filtering the second image
    and then combining the two. The two examples and one failed example are shown below. The hyperparameter values for the Gaussian filter were
    set through experimentation and qualitative assesment.</p>

    <p>The Fourier output images are calculated as shown in the spec for the Cat and Derek image combination</p>

    <h2>2.3 - Gaussian and Laplacian stacks</h2>
    <p>The Gaussian stack is made by consistently applying the Gaussian blur on the original image. The Laplacian stack on the other hand,
    is created by subtracting consecutive iamges in the Gaussian stack, highlighting/extracting all the high frequancies from the image. The stacks for the 
    orange and apple are shown below.</p>

    <img src="./images/gaussian_orange.png" alt="lowres3">
    <img src="./images/laplacian_orange.png" alt="lowres3">

    <h2>2.4 - Multiresolution Blending</h2>
    <p>From the Gaussian and Laplacian stacks, we can create a mask that can be used to merge the two images. For the orapple, the mask is 
just one side/half of the image, but I have created a circular mask for one of the examples. For process for blending, I created a Laplacian
stack with the merged images and summed over the whole stack, including the last item so that all the low and high frequencies are added up
to create the final image.</p>

    <p>Some other examples are shown below. The New York skyline day and night merged image is made with the rectangular/vertical split mask, but the last example
    shown is made with a circular mask restricted by a radius parameter.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I have taken some inspiration from ChatGPT and pretrained LLM's to create the structure for some parts of the website.</p>
